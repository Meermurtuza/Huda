      <strong>Dear Huda,</strong><br /><br />
      I don’t know if you’ve ever noticed, but you have this rare way of making everything around you feel brighter. It’s like you’re carrying a little universe of your own, and anyone who crosses paths with you can feel it. <br /><br />
      Maybe you’ll never know how much you’ve inspired me, or how often I find myself smiling just because of something you said or the way you laughed. But I hope one day, you do. <br /><br />
      <em>(Maybe this is more than just admiration… 👀)</em><br /><br />
      <strong>Sincerely,<br />Meer Murtuza</strong>
